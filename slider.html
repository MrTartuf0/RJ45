      <h1>History of Internet</h1>
      <p>
        The history of the Internet has its origin in information theory
         and the efforts to build and interconnect computer networks that
          arose from research and development in the United States and
           involved international collaboration, particularly with 
           researchers in the United Kingdom and France.

            long distant dial-up between a TX-2 computer in Massachusetts

            Arpanet was the first real network to run on packet switching technology (new at the time). 
            On October 29, 1969, computers at Stanford and UCLA connected for the first time. In effect, 
            they were the first hosts on what would one day become the Internet. The first message sent 
            across the network was supposed to be “Login”, but reportedly, the link between the two 
            colleges crashed on the letter “g”.

          <h2>IRC – Internet Relay Chat</h2>
          <p>
            Also in 1988, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) was first deployed, 
            paving the way for real-time chat and the instant messaging 
            programs we use today.

          <h2>First major malicious internet-based attack</h2>
          <p>
            One of the first major Internet worms was released in 1988. 
            Referred to as “The Morris Worm”, it was written by 
            Robert Tappan Morris and caused major interruptions 
            across large parts of the Internet.

          <h2>AOL is launched</h2>
          <p>
            When Apple pulled out of the AppleLink program in 1989, 
            the project was renamed and America Online was born. AOL, 
            still in existence today, later on made the Internet popular 
            amongst the average internet users.

          <h2>The proposal for the World Wide Web</h2>
          <p>
            1989 also brought about the proposal for the World Wide Web, written by Tim Berners-Lee. 
            It was originally published in the March issue of MacWorld, and then redistributed in May 1990. 
            It was written to persuade CERN that a global hypertext system was in CERN’s best interest. 
            It was originally called “Mesh”; the term “World Wide Web” 
            was coined while Berners-Lee was writing the code in 1990.

          <p>
            1990 also brought about the first commercial dial-up Internet provider, 
            The World. The same year, Arpanet ceased to exist.

            The code for the World Wide Web was written by Tim Berners-Lee, 
            based on his proposal from the year before, along with the 
            standards for HTML, HTTP, and URLs.

            1991 brought some major innovations to the world of the Internet. 
            The first web page was created and, much like the first email 
            explained what email was, its purpose was to explain what the World Wide Web was.

            Also, the MP3 file format was accepted as a standard in 1991. 
            MP3 files, being highly compressed, later become a popular file 
            format to share songs and entire albums via the internet.

          <p>
            One of the more interesting developments of this era, though, 
            was the first webcam. It was deployed at a Cambridge University 
            computer lab, and its sole purpose was to monitor a particular 
            coffee maker so that lab users could avoid wasted trips to an empty coffee pot.

            The first widely downloaded Internet browser, Mosaic, 
            was released in 1993. While Mosaic wasn’t the first 
            web browser, it is considered the first browser to 
            make the Internet easily accessible to non-techies.
